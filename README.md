# challenge 1

Grading student marks
This program prompts the user to enter marks, from 0 - 100
then grades its.
if grade > 79 && grade <=100 is an A
else if grade >=60 && grade <=79 is a B
else if grade >=50 && grade <=59 is a C
else if grade >=40 && grade <=49 is a D
else if grade >=0&& grade <40 is a Fail
else the input is invalid

# challenge 2

speed detector

this program computes demerit points from the given speed
if speed is less than 70 no demerit point. if above 70 
demerit points are calculated by subtracting 70 from the given
speed then dividing the outcome by 5. whatever you get are the demerit points.
if demerit points exceed 12 the driver is suspended
